                These past months you have given me the love I spent asking  for the longest time. 
                A love that is full of peace, mutual healthy obsession, gentle affection and intimacy. I honestly feel like you can read me 
                like an open book sometimes, your love is teaching me what feeling safe is, that I am enough
                without having to make myself smaller or dim my feelings. Even in silence or far apart I feel calm instead of fear and anxiety.
                My beautiful girl, you are the answer, my world, my reason to actually want to keep going. I want to keep building our relationship,
                learning about you so I can master the art of loving you, becuase to be loved is to be known, and I already know some parts of you that I love takin care of.
                I want you to know that I am here for you, in every moment, 
                for every joy and every challenge. I am yours, in ways both big and small, and my heart will always be open to you. 
                What we have is rare, and I treasure it more than words can express.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love you so so much<br>
